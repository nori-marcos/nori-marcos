### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marcos Nori, a software developer from Brazil. I'm currently working as a backend developer at LuizaLabs, the innovation and technology unit of Magazine Luiza. This company is one of the largest retail companies in Brazil and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: MGLU3).

I went through a career transition, migrating from International Relations to Computer Science. Because of this experience, I believe that technology can be learned by anyone and that it can be a powerful tool for social, economic and political transformation.

In 2022, I completed a "Full Stack Web Development" bootcamp by Santander Coders, which was important to get my first job opportunity as a backend developer at LuizaLabs. It means that I am able to work with both frontend and backend technologies.

Today I am also studying a degree in Computer Science at the University of BrasÃ­lia (UnB) and participating in a voluntary educational robotics project for children and adolescents, Br.ino. These both experiences are helping me to improve my skills as a software developer and go further in my career.

I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects and to learn more about software development. I'm also open to job opportunities.
